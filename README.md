#### Technology I'm comfortable with

* Java, C#
* SQL
* Javascript, ES6, React
* Go golang
* N-tier architectures, AWS

#### Technology I'm interested in

* **Rust**. Gaining momentum, very versatile.  Used in [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker), blockchain (SOL, DOT, ETH), [Nitro](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/), embedded (ESP32/STM32).  It might even have space to challenge Java in the enterprise software market.
* **Typescript**. Bringing stronger typing to Javascript seems like a good thing.
* **Flutter/Dart**. One of the strongest contenders in the unified mobile space.  This appears to be a practical way forward to support many devices affordably. Many applications do not need native performance.  I'm still interested in Swift and Kotlin, though.
* **Containerization**. The idea of scripting, automating, and encapsulating an environment ensures a uniform environment across machines and time. Docker is but one implementation. VS Code's Docker integration is the future.

#### Headings I've ended a prepostion with
