#### Technology I'm comfortable with

* Java, C#
* SQL
* Javascript, ES6, React
* Go golang, python
* N-tier architectures, AWS

#### Technology I'm interested in

* **Flutter**. One of the strongest contenders in the unified mobile space.  This appears to be a practical way forward to support many devices affordably. Many applications do not need native performance.  I'm still interested in Swift and Kotlin, though.
* **Typescript**. Bringing stronger typing to Javascript seems like a good thing.
* **Ruby + Rails**. I'm late to this game. I've had a "static-only" bias early in my career, working primarily on enterprisey software, but lately I've come around to favoring the fast iteration cycle of dynamically-typed languages.

#### Headings I've ended a prepostion with
